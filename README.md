# volumio-pydpiper-plugin

The rest of the readme will follow, but I claim no rights to the pydPiper software, all work has been done by dhrone; which I thankfully bundled and use. I merely created an installable plugin, which allows for easy configuration of LCD screens.

Questions?
Ask nicely and I'm more than happy to help when I can.

Instructions to install were removed as per request by Volumio, you can always find the manual on the Volumio plugin pages: https://volumio.github.io/docs/Plugin_System/Plugin_System_Overview

The PR to add this plugin to the official store can be found here: https://github.com/volumio/volumio-plugins/pull/419

Please bear in mind, you can freely use any of the code/scripts, but the community creates these in their own time (without any compensation). A big shout out to Dhrone for the amazing work done to containerize LCD control scripts!
